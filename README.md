# My portfolio

To deploy to public, be on the main branch and run `npm run deploy`. This branch will then contain the npm build elements.

To save the code privately, push instad from the `code` branch by `git push private code`

It's a bit convoluted, as the `main` and `code` branches are the same on my local machine and are merged to each other back and forth. One branch would be enough, as long I never `pull` from github.
